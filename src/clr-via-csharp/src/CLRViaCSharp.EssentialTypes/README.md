# Chars, Strings and working with text

## Characters

- represented in 16-bit Unicode code values
- A character is represented with an instance of the System.Char structure, so char is a value type

# Strings

- Represents an immutable sequence of characters.
- Is a reference type
- can't use ___new___ operator to construct a string object
